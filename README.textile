* …

*escape*
Escape HTML entities such as @<@, @>@ and @&@ prior to echoing the field contents.

h2(#examples). Example

Produce a gallery of custom video poster-images (from images assigned to the image category "videos") that open a corresponding youtube video (defined in the image custom field) in a lightbox modal:

bc. <txp:images wraptag="ul" break="li" category="videos" class="video-gallery">
  <a href="//www.youtube.com/watch?v=<txp:jcr_image_custom />" title="<txp:image_info type="caption" />" data-lity>
    <txp:thumbnail />
  </a>
</txp:images>

p. where the image custom field is used to store the Video ID of the YouTube video. This example uses the "lity":http://sorgalla.com/lity/ lightbox script.


h2. Changing the label of the custom field

The name of custom field can be changed by specifying a new label using the _Install from Textpack_ field in the "Admin › Languages":http://docs.textpattern.io/administration/languages-panel panel. Enter your own information in the following pattern and click *Upload*:

bc.. #@admin
#@language en-gb
jcr_image_custom => Your label

p. replacing @en-gb@ with your own language and @Your label@ with your own desired label.


h2(#deinstallation). De-installation

The plugin cleans up after itself: deinstalling the plugin removes the extra column from the database. To stop using the plugin but keep the database tables, just disable (deactivate) the plugin but don't delete it.
